          <h2 id="gendesc">    General Description</h2>
          <pre>    Welcome to Neven's Minecraft website!

    As you may have guessed, my name is Neven!  I have been playing Minecraft 
    for a couple of months now.  For those unfamiliar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft">Minecraft</a>,
    it is a famous sandbox video game created by game developer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markus_Persson">Markus Persson</a>,
    released in 2011.  The game has gone on to become the single <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/minecraft-becomes-best-selling-game-all-time-its-10th-birthday">best-selling</a> 
    video game of all time.  It features many different game modes, most of
    which involve creative construction elements.  It is a game where players
    can express their own creativity and choose to forge their own paths in
    the large open world!

    I only recently began playing PS4 Minecraft's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft#Survival_mode">survival mode</a>.  In survival,
    the player must gather resources and survive inside of a hostile environment
    which features many dangers and perils; the risk of death is always present,
    ranging from death by dangerous monsters to starvation or falling in lava.  
    While playing in survival mode may be quite challenging, it is quite 
    rewarding at the same time!

    The purpose of this website is to showcase my PS4 Minecraft world,
    colloquially know as <i>Neven World</i>.  I have invested many hours and
    sleepless nights improving upon Neven World, and building my mega-base.
    This website will be the perfect venue to document the ins and outs of my
    base, while also providing the opportunity for others to apply and be a part
    of the Neven World experience!  Neven World was not built by Neven alone,
    and this website will serve to acknowledge all contributers!

                      Neven's PS4 and can be accessed by invite-only.  Executive decisions regarding the main<br>

                      one who got Neven into playing Minecraft as he had played previously.  Neven has since <br>
                      far surpassed Justin in terms of skill and superiority.  Despite his inferiority, Justin <br>
                      has been pivotal in the development of the main base and has helped to further exploration <br>
